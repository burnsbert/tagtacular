Tagtacular is an open source tag management jQuery plugin released under the MIT License, the same license jQuery and jQueryUI use.

The goals of this project are that a tags management jQuery plugin should:
1. be very easy to setup with default behavior
2. have very flexible customization options
3. have minimal requirements and assumptions beyond jQuery and jQueryUI
